**5 Simple Reasons to Use Django:**

1. **Built-in Features and Rapid Development**  
   Django comes with many features out of the box, like an admin interface, authentication, ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), and form handling. These tools make it quick to develop applications without building everything from scratch.

2. **Security-Focused Framework**  
   Django has built-in protection against common security threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and clickjacking. This security focus helps developers create secure applications without much extra effort.

3. **Scalable and Robust**  
   Django is designed to handle high traffic and can scale well with the needs of growing applications. Its architecture and modularity make it a solid choice for larger, complex projects.

4. **Comprehensive Documentation and Community Support**  
   Django has thorough and well-organized documentation, which helps new developers quickly get started and seasoned developers find detailed information when needed. It also has a large, active community, offering support and third-party packages.

5. **Versatile and Flexible**  
   Django is suitable for many types of applications, from content management systems and e-commerce sites to APIs for mobile and web applications. With Django REST Framework, it’s easy to create RESTful APIs alongside traditional web views.

**What to Watch Out for When Using Django:**

1. **Monolithic Structure**  
   Django follows the "batteries-included" philosophy, which can lead to a monolithic structure. While this is great for rapid development, it can be less flexible if you want to swap out certain components, especially in large or complex projects.

2. **Performance Overheads**  
   Django’s abstraction layers, especially the ORM, can introduce performance overheads in high-scale applications. If fine-tuned database interactions are critical, Django’s ORM might not be the best fit without careful optimization.

3. **Learning Curve for Beginners**  
   While Django makes many things easier, it has a relatively steep learning curve if you’re new to web development or to Python, especially when it comes to understanding the ORM, views, and settings configurations.

4. **Heavy on Server Resources**  
   Django requires more memory and processing power than some lighter frameworks, which can make hosting and scaling more resource-intensive if the application grows quickly or demands high performance.

5. **Version Compatibility and Third-Party Packages**  
   As Django and its packages are actively maintained, newer versions of Django can sometimes have compatibility issues with older packages. It’s important to track dependencies carefully to avoid disruptions during updates.
